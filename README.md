## Project_Umbra

Most of the new files can be found within the Source folder and the Content/ThirdPerson/Umbra folder

This demo contains 2 character types:
 - The "cyber-ghost" is unable to interact with most objects, but can teleport and possess robots
 - Robots are hollow shells which are slow but can interact with the world to allow the ghost to progress

Aside from the basic third person controls (WASD movement and spacebar for jump), there are 2 additional controls:
 - E (Keyboard) or Left Face Button (Gamepad) allows the player to possess and unpossess robots
 - Q (Keyboard) or Right Face Button (Gamepad) can be held then released to perform a teleport as the cyber-ghost
    - The range of the teleport expands the longer the input is held
    - Teleporting into a robot will automatically possess it

There are various objects to interact with in the world, such as:
 - Automatic doors which open for specific character types
 - Doors which open using weighted buttons
 - Dormant robots to possess
